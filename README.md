Hey there! I'm a passionate DevOps enthusiast and Computer Science student, turning code into seamless, scalable deployments. I live for automating the chaos, bridging dev and ops, and building infrastructures that just *work*. Currently honing my skills in cloud-native apps, GitOps, and CI/CD magic. Let's automate the world together! 🌍

## 🔄 My DevOps Philosophy
DevOps isn't just tools—it's a mindset. I believe in continuous improvement, collaboration, and delivering value fast. From provisioning infra with Terraform to orchestrating with Kubernetes, I'm all about making deployments as smooth as this GIF:

## 🌟 Featured DevOps Adventures (Projects)
Dive into my hands-on experiments where I tamed microservices and pipelines:

### 1. GitOps Retail Cloud on AWS EKS
- Transformed a retail app into a cloud-native beast using Terraform for infra, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Argo CD for GitOps glory.
- Automated everything: Builds with GitHub Actions, pushes to ECR, and syncs that keep deployments humming.
- Result: Scalable, self-healing microservices ready for prime time.

### 2. CI/CD Voting App with Azure & K8s
- Crafted a pipeline in Azure DevOps that builds, tests, and deploys like clockwork.
- Dockerized services, rolled them out to Kubernetes with Argo CD, and added auto-rollouts/rollbacks for zero-downtime vibes.
- From code commit to production monitor—seamless flow achieved!
